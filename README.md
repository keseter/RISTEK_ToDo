## Essay
  I put RISTEK's figma, Dribble and Mockplus design
as a reference point, as i found them stunning, I wanted to make a ToDo app that is actually unique, after looking at a bunch of ToDo apps I found that almost none of them were
engaging or attracting, so i designed the concept of my ToDo app that is attracting through the UI color and widgets, engaging through features such as point system, analytics and
social page which will be implemented in the future. This is my first time doing actual research and planning before creating an app, I realized that it is more time efficient 
and you would have a clearer view, meaning less problems and a clearer goal.

  I am grateful AI such as chatGPT and Youtube as they are my learning reference, Chat GPT is a great source
to ask for widgets that you dont know already existed and would be a great fit for your app, it is somewhat great for debugging and building widgets based on your prompt,
in the process of building this app i relied heavily on the AI, though in the process be able to learn using comments line per line on how the code functions, terms such
as async, await, override and widgets such as date, InkWell, Scaffold Messanger  were term that were unfamiliar to me, but now i realized how fitting to use them.
Though I also learned to not be heavily dependent on AI, some time was wasted in fixing bugs or building widgets that was not complicated to me as a developer, so learning while doing 
is a crucial element. One the other hand Youtube creator such as Mitch Koko helped me with the basics of Flutter giving me a solid foundation in creating a fully functional app.
